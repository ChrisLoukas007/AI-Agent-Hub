AI Agent Hub is a modular project designed to demonstrate the skills of a junior AI engineer.
It combines modern AI components such as a FastAPI backend, Ollama LLM, Qdrant vector database, MLflow experiment tracking, and an MCP server for tool integration.
The system runs fully containerized using Docker and supports both local and cloud deployments.
Its main purpose is to show how an engineer can design, build, and deploy a production-ready RAG-based assistant.
