The Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows an LLM to interact with external tools in a controlled and standardized way.
In AI Agent Hub, the MCP server exposes utilities such as Qdrant search, MLflow metric logging, and web content retrieval.
This enables the LLM to act as an agent that can execute real actions rather than just generate text.
MCP integration demonstrates advanced AI engineering capabilities.
